#Bucket List

Created at Code Fellows by Hannah, Lily, and Monica.

###The App

This app is designed for consumers at grocery stores. It allows the user to input their shopping list into the app, which then organizes their products by what section of the grocery store they're in.

Once the user arrives at the grocery store, they press the "start shopping button," at which point a timer starts and they start shopping. Once they cross off the last item on the list, the timer stops and displays how long it took them.

###Resources Utilized

* Our base is mostly normalize.css.
* We used some features from jQuery UI.
* Some parts of layout.css are based off of Skeleton.
* [This](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp) page was very helpful in making our timer.
* Autocomplete help came from [Devbridge](http://www.devbridge.com/sourcery/components/jquery-autocomplete/)
* Lots of Googling and Stack Overflow questions helped us through our struggles.
* And as always, thanks to the team at Code Fellows for their constant help and for putting up with our giggling.
